## Description üè†                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                   
AirBnB is a complete web application, integrating database storage, a back-end 
and front-end interfacing in a clone of AirBnB.                                                                                
                                                                                                                                   
The project currently only implements the back-end console.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                   
## Classes üÜë                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                   
AirBnB utilizes the following classes:                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                   
## Storage üõÑ                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                   
The above classes are handled by the abstracted storage engine defined in the FileStorage class.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                   
Every time the backend is initialized, AirBnB instantiates an instance of                                                    
FileStorage called storage. The storage object is loaded/re-loaded from any class                                                  
instances stored in the JSON file file.json. As class instances are created, updated, or
deleted, the storage object is used to register corresponding changess                                                  
in the file.json. 

## Console üíª                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                   
The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the backend                                                  
of AirBnB. It can be used to handle and manipulate all classes utilized  the application
(achieved by calls on the storage object defined above).                                                         
                                                                                                                                   
#### Using the Console                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                   
The AirBnB console can be run both interactively and non-interactively. To                                                  
run the console in non-interactive mode, pipe any command(s) into an execution                                                    
of the file console.py at the command line.

Alternatively, to use the AirBnB console in interactive mode, run the file                                                  
console.py by itself:

While running in interactive mode, the console displays a prompt for input:

To quit the console, enter the command quit, or input an EOF signal (ctrl-D).
